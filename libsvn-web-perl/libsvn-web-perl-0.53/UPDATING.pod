UPDATING

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Notes on updating from previous versions of SVN::Web

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you have not modified the supplied template files the update can
be carried out by:

=over 4

=item 1.

Backing up your existing F<config.yaml> file.

=item 2.

Removing all the files in your current C<svnweb> directory.

=item 3.

Running C<svnweb-install> from this distribution.  This will copy the new
templates, as well as creating a new F<config.yaml>.

=item 4.

Restoring the F<config.yaml> that you backed up in step 1, and making
any changes, as described below.

=back

If you have made local modifications then the following information should
help you merge the changes in this version in to your modified files.

=head2 0.52 to 0.53

=over

=item

Update the C<version> key in your configuration file to 0.53.

=item

Subversion paths are now escaped by SVN::Web before being passed to the
templates, resulting in a change to every template that contains a path.
In general, this means that where previously you would write:

  [% path | uri | html %]

in a template, now you can just write

  [% path %]

If you do not re-run C<svnweb-install> when you upgrade to this
version you B<must> update the templates by hand.

=back

=head2 0.51 to 0.52

=over

=item

Update the C<version> key in your configuration file to 0.52.

=back

=head2 0.50 to 0.51

=over

=item

Update the C<version> key in your configuration file to 0.51.

=back

=head2 0.49 to 0.50

=over 4

=item

The configuration file must now contain a C<version> key, the value of
which must match the SVN::Web version.  If it is not present, or does
not match, SVN::Web will C<die()>, and generate an appropriate error in
the logs.

Add this line:

  version: 0.50

to F<config.yaml>, after making sure that you have updated the
configuration file to contain all the necessary new directives.

=item

There are many new configuration options for actions.  Either run
C<svnweb-install>, as advised above, or view the documentation for
each action, which has been updated to show the new entries that
should be placed in F<config.yaml> for the action.

This change has also affected all the action templates save for
F<list> and F<rss>.  There is a new F<Template/trac/_action_menu>
template.

=item

L<SVN::Web::Blame> has been added, with an associated
F<Template/trac/blame> template.

=item

Diff generation has changed, resulting in changes to F<Template/trac/diff>
and F<Template/trac/revision>.  There is a new F<Template/trac/_diff>
template.

=item

The F<Template/trac/log> template has changed to support paging through
results and changing how many results are displayed per page.

=item

The F<Template/trac/rss> template has changed to wrap the contents
of the <description> element in a CDATA marker.

=item

The F<I18N/en.po> localisation file contains several new and updated
entries.

=back

=head2 0.48 to 0.49

=over 4

=item

F<Template/trac/header>, F<Template/trac/browse>, F<Template/trac/log>,
F<Template/trav/view>, and F<Style/trac/browser.css> have been updated
for HTML compliance.

=item

F<Template/trac/diff> no longer uses the CGI module to retrieve the
current URL.

=back

=head2 0.47 to 0.48

place.

L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision/?rev=881>.

=item

F<trac/header> and F<trac/log> have been updated to use the C<at_head>

=back

=head2 0.45 to 0.46

This was a bug fix release, with no changes to the templates,
localisation, or configuration files.

=head2 0.44 to 0.45

This was a bug fix release, with no changes to the templates,
localisation, or configuration files.

=head2 0.43 to 0.44

If you have not modified the supplied templates and localisation files
the update can be carried out by:

=over 4

=item 1.

Backing up your existing F<config.yaml> file.

=item 2.

Removing all the files in your current C<svnweb> directory.

=item 3.

Running C<svnweb-install> from this distribution.  This will copy the new
templates and localisation files, as well as creating a new F<config.yaml>.

=item 4.

Restoring the F<config.yaml> that you backed up in step 1.

=back

If you have made local modifications then the following information should
help you merge the changes in this version in to your modified files.

=over 4

=item

The F<trac/log> template has been changed to remove some output from
comments.  Although this output was never seen, generating it used CPU
and memory.  This was especially apparent on changes that affected
many files.  Using the new F<trac/log> template (or merging the change
in by hand) will speed up log browsing.

The diff for these changes is at
L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision/?rev=793>.

=item

F<I18N/en.po> has been updated with a new error message when an invalid
revision number is specified.

The diff for these changes is at
L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/diff/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/trunk/lib/SVN/Web/I18N/en.po?revs=794&revs=788>.

=item

F<I18N/en.po> and F<trac/browse> have been updated to show a file's age,
relative to the last commit that affected it.

The diffs for these changes are at L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/diff/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/trunk/lib/SVN/Web/I18N/en.po?revs=788&revs=719>
and L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/diff/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/trunk/lib/SVN/Web/Template/trac/browse?revs=788&revs=553>.

=back

=head2 0.42 to 0.43

=over 4

=item

The F<en.po> localisation file and F<diff> template have been changed to
support viewing plain text diffs.  Either copy the supplied files over
your copies, or merge the changes in by hand if you are using your own
templates.

The diff for these changes is at
L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision/?rev=719>.

=item

L<SVN::Web::Revision> has a new option controlling whether or not diffs
are shown when viewing a revision.  To support it the F<revision> template
has changed.  Either copy the supplied template over your copy, or merge
the changes by hand if you are using your own template.

The diff for this change is at
L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision?rev=721>.

=item

The templates F<trac/trac.css> and F<trac/code.css> have been changed
to remove references to images that are not shipped in this distribution.
This will stop web browsers requesting them, and keeps C<svnweb-server>
quiet.  It's not essential that you update your copies accordingly, but
it doesn't hurt either.

The diff for this change is at
L<http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision?rev=764>.

=back

=head2 0.41 to 0.42

=over 4

=item

The format for specifying actions in the configuration file has changed.
In addition, there are no longer any default actions -- any actions not
specified in the configuration file will be ignored.

To retain existing functionality you must ensure that the following
appears in F<config.yaml>.

  actions:
    browse:
      class: SVN::Web::Browse
    checkout:
      class: SVN::Web::Checkout
    diff:
      class: SVN::Web::Diff
    list:
      class: SVN::Web::List
    log:
      class: SVN::Web::Log
    revision:
      class: SVN::Web::Revision
    rss:
      class: SVN::Web::RSS
    view:
      class: SVN::Web::View

=item

There have been several changes to the F<trac> templates.  If you have made
any local modifications then you will need to merge your changes in to the
new templates.

=item

Use of the C<templatedir> configuration directive is now deprecated.  You
should use C<templatedirs> instead.  This is to support third party actions
that supply their own templates in different directories.

C<templatedir> in the configuration file will continue to work, but you
should change existing entries of the form:

  templatedir: '/path/to/directory'

to this form:

  templatedirs:
    - '/path/to/directory'

A configuration file that specifies both C<templatedir> and C<templatedirs>
will generate an exception when anyone browses the repository.

=back

=head2 0.40 to 0.41

After installing the new module you should copy
F<lib/Templates/trac/header> to F<< <dir>/template/trac/header >>, where
F<< <dir> >> is the directory in which you ran C<svnweb-install>.

=head2 Anything < 0.40 to 0.40

The 0.40 release includes sweeping changes to the templates, as well
as additional functionality and configuration directives.  See F<CHANGES>
for details.

The simplest approach is to backup your existing F<config.yaml> and then
re-run C<svnweb-install>.  This will generate a new F<config.yaml> and
copy over the new templates and other files.

It should be easy to migrate your old configuration directives to the new
configuration file.
