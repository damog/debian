[%# This file defines a macro, 'log_msg', that you should call to format
    Subversion log messages.

    The macro can pass the message through multiple filters to ensure that
    it is formatted correctly.

    To override this file, either edit it directly, or (preferred), make
    a copy of it, and use the 'templatedirs' directive in config.yaml
    to specify the directory you copied it to.  Then edit the copy.

    Here is the default definition.  It converts the message to HTML, and
    retains the original line breaks.
%]

[% MACRO log_msg(text)
   text | html | html_line_break %]

[%# Here is a more complex example.  There's the same HTML conversion as
    before.  In addition,

    * Template::Plugin::Clickable and Template::Plugin::Clickable::Email
      are used to find URIs and e-mail addresses and make them clickable.

    * Strings that look like 'r1234' in the log message are converted
      to links to the 'revision' action for this repository.  Note the
      use of ${c.script} and ${c.repos} to ensure that the correct
      repository is used.

    * Strings that look like 'rt#1234' are converted to links to the
      relevant RT ticket in the CPAN ticketing system.

    Comment out the previous definition, and remove the '#' on the first
    line of this definition to use it.

[%# You can also define different results per-repository.  For example,
    if you have two repositories that both use 'rt#1234' to refer to tickets,
    but that use two different RT instances, you might define it like so:

[%#
   USE rt1 = Subst
     pattern     = 'rt#(\d+)'                     
     replacement = '<a href="/rt1/rt.cgi?id=$1">rt#$1</a>'
     global      = 1;

   USE rt2 = Subst
     pattern     = 'rt#(\d+)'                     
     replacement = '<a href="/rt2/rt.cgi?id=$1">rt#$1</a>'
     global      = 1;

   MACRO log_msg(text)
     SWITCH c.repos;
     CASE 'repo1';
       text | html | html_line_break | $rt1;
