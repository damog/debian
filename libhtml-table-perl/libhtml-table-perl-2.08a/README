NAME
    HTML::Table - Create HTML tables using simple interface

INSTALL
    In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
    5.002 or better.  Installation as usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::Table is used to generate HTML tables for
    CGI scripts.  By using the methods provided fairly
    complex tables can be created, manipulated, then printed
    from Perl scripts.  The module also greatly simplifies
    creating tables within tables from Perl.  It is possible
    to create an entire table using the methods provided and
    never use an HTML tag.

    HTML::Table also allows for creating dynamically sized
    tables via its addRow and addCol methods.  These methods
    automatically resize the table if passed more cell values
    than will fit in the current table grid.

    Methods are provided for nearly all valid table, row, and
    cell tags specified for HTML 3.0.

HISTORY
    This module was originally created in 1997 by Stacy Lacy and whose last 
	version was uploaded to CPAN in 1998.  The module was adopted in July 2000 
	by Anthony Peacock in order to distribute a revised version.  This adoption 
	took place without the explicit consent of Stacy Lacy as it proved impossible 
	to contact them at the time.  Explicit consent for the adoption has since been 
	received.
