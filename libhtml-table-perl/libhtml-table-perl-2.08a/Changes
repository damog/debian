Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Table.

2.08a 23 June 2008
	- Fixed outputing row class attribute twice.
	  Request and fix from Reinhard Mutz

2.08  10 April 2008
	- Added delRow and delSectionRow methods.
	  Request from Kyle Davenport <kyle.davenport at fmr.com>
	- Fixed error in getTable, which output the wrong section attributes.
	  Request and fix from Colin Fine <colin.fine at pace.co.uk>
	- Added getSection method to modularize the creation of Section HTML.
	- Created new set of methods which apply Cell attributes across a row.  This is to make
	  a clear distinction from those methods that set row attributes (tr).
	  Suggest by Colin Fine <colin.fine at pace.co.uk>

2.07b
	  05 February 2008
	- Fixed error in setSectionRowWidth.
	  Request from Ravi Kondamuru <ravikondamuru at gmail.com>

2.07-beta
	  13 September 2007
	- Added THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY sections.
	  Request from Miguel Santinho <msantinho at simplicidade.com>.
	  
	  There are now methods that take a section and section number as parameters.
	  ie. setSectionCell ( 'tbody', 0, 2, 3, 'Cell 2,3'); 
	  
	  Existing methods default to working on the first tbody section, for backwards 
	  compatibility.
	  
	  You can have only one each of tfoot and thead sections, but multiple tbody sections.
